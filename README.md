```lrc
[00:20.13] Once you fell out of love
[00:24.12] Our love couldn't carry you
[00:28.78] And I didn't even notice
[00:33.73] For our love
[00:36.13] Kept me save from death
[00:47.63] 
[00:48.83] You doubted the light
[00:52.98] And the shelter it can give
[00:57.55] For in love we are immortal
[01:02.29] Eternal and safe from death
[01:15.79] 
[01:08.25] If I regret us
[01:11.89] I'm denying my soul to grow
[01:17.18] Don't remove my pain
[01:21.98] It is my chance to heal
[01:33.48] 
[01:28.38] We carry the same wound
[01:30.91] But have different cures
[01:35.64] Similar injuries
[01:39.98] But opposite remedies
[01:50.48] 
[02:05.87] After our love ended
[02:10.07] Your arms don't carry me
[02:14.82] Without love I feel the abyss
[02:19.14] Understand your fear of death
[02:33.64] 
[02:24.23] I will not forget
[02:29.58] This notget
[02:34.22] Will you not regret
[02:38.86] Having love let go
[02:47.86] 
[02:44.39] After our love ended
[02:48.64] Your spirit entered me
[02:52.90] Now we are the guardians
[02:57.86] We keep her safe from death
[03:11.36] 
[03:11.87] Love will keep us safe from death
